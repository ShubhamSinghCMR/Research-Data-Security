# Research Work - Data Security

A research-focused repository containing implementations, experimental code, and supporting materials related to **data security and integrity verification** in distributed and cloud-based systems.

This repository consolidates research work addressing secure data storage, integrity auditing, and verification mechanisms, particularly in environments where data is shared, dynamic, or outsourced to untrusted servers.
